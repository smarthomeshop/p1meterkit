# P1MeterKit firmware – GitHub Pages branch (gh-pages)

This branch hosts the public firmware artifacts and manifests for P1MeterKit. It is served via GitHub Pages and is intended to be consumed by:
- ESP Web Tools (browser-based flashing)
- OTA update integrations (using the JSON manifest)

## Do not edit manually
Files in this branch are generated by the CI workflow in the default branch. Any manual changes will be overwritten on the next publish.

## Layout
- `p1meterkit-v1/` — Firmware binaries for V1 (ESP8266)
- `p1meterkit-v2/` — Firmware binaries for V2 (ESP32-C3)
- `p1meterkit-v1-manifest.json` — Aggregate manifest for V1
- `p1meterkit-v2-manifest.json` — Aggregate manifest for V2

## OTA update manifest
The P1MeterKit V2 firmware consumes the manifest directly for OTA updates.

## How this branch is updated
On pushes to the main branch, the CI pipeline builds all variants and deploys to this branch.
